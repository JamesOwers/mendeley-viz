## Category
_What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?_

## Context
_Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem_

## Correctness
_Do the assumptions appear to be valid?_

## Contributions
_What are the paper's main contributions? What questions does the paper attempt to answer?_
